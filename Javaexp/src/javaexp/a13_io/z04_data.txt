The last few months,
I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones
who loved me, baby
I look back now and realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me
with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine,
out of time
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like
